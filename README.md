Fine grain Image Classification

Several models and loss functions were use for evaluating results on three fine-grain datasets. The models implemented are in the models folder, while the loss functions are in the loss.py file.
All the models can be trained using the main.py. The training logic is shown in the run.py file, we have made it to evaluate top-1 and top-5 accuracy on training as well as on inference.
